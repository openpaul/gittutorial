# Installing git
Installing git is easy. Especially in linux

## Windows
Just go to https://git-scm.com/downloads install from there.

## Mac
Just go to https://git-scm.com/downloads install from there.

## Linux 

For linux just check if git is already installed:

```
which git
```
If nothing comes up just install via you package manager.

E.g in ubuntu/debian:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

For other package managers it is explained nicely here:

https://git-scm.com/download/linux
